//! Round Toward Zero (RTZ) floating-point rounding mode control

//! Rust/LLVM does not support different float point mode rounding modes and
//! this module provides abstractions to able to control the aarch64
//! FPCR (Floating-point Control Register) rounding mode. For how this module
//! provides a safe abstraction see the documentation of [`Mode`].

/// Call closure with a specific rounding mode.
///
///  `with_rounding_mode` provides a safe-ish abstraction (see Safety
/// section) to run a function under a non-default floating-point
/// rounding mode. Once the closure finishes the rounding mode is
/// restored to what it was before the call.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use fp_rounding::{with_rounding_mode, Positive, RoundingGuard};
///
/// fn requires_round_to_positive(_: &RoundingGuard<Positive>, a: f64) {
///     let b = 2.0_f64.powi(-53);
///     assert_ne!(a + b, a);
///     assert_eq!(a - b, a);
/// }
///
/// unsafe {
///     with_rounding_mode(1.1, requires_round_to_positive);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This function is marked unsafe for the following reasons:
///
/// 1) Rust/LLVM does not have any built-ins for changing the float point
///    mode rounding modes and this wonâ€™t prevent the Rust compiler from
///    making invalid inferences as described [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/471#issuecomment-1774261953).
///
/// 2) For performance reasons the struct acts as a proof that the rounding mode
///    has been set. This means that when you nest two call to
///    `with_rounding_mode` with different rounding modes the closest
///    `with_rounding_mode` in the call stack determines the rounding mode.

    input: Input,

) -> Result {
    let input = fence(input);
    // - The for 'a prevents the Mode token from being leaked by the closure.
    // - The function f is marked !Send + !Sync due to Mode
    // - The function f takes a reference to [`Mode`] such that on nested calls the
